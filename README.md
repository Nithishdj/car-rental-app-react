## 🎓 About My Training at Changepond Technologies
I built this project as part of my **Full Stack Development Training** at Changepond Technologies. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

### 🚀 What I Learned & Implemented
During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

1.  **React.js Fundamentals:** Mastering Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef`) for state management and side effects.
2.  **Routing & Navigation:** Implementing `react-router-dom` for seamless page transitions and protected routes (Admin vs. User).
3.  **State Management:** Using the **Context API** for global authentication state and user data management.
4.  **CRUD Operations:** Interacting with a REST API (JSON Server) to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data for cars and bookings.
5.  **Form Validation:** Implementing strict input validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number restriction, date logic).
6.  **UI/UX Design:** Creating modern, card-based layouts and responsive tables using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
7.  **Version Control:** Using **Git & GitHub** for source code management and collaboration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Routing:** React Router v6
* **State Management:** React Context API
* **Backend (Mock):** JSON Server (simulating a REST API)
* **Icons:** React Icons
* **Version Control:** Git
